Notes:

Overview

"Rise of Kingdoms" is a real-time strategy game developed by Lilith Games, released in 2018 for mobile platforms and later for PC. The game allows players to lead a civilization from a single city to a vast empire, engaging in exploration, combat, and alliance-building. 

Civilizations

Players can choose from 14 distinct civilizations, each offering unique bonuses, special units, and a starting commander. The available civilizations include Rome, Japan, China, Korea, Britain, Greece, Egypt, Arabia, the Ottoman Empire, Byzantium, France, Germany, Spain, and the Vikings. Each civilization provides specific advantages; for example, China offers a 5% building speed boost and starts with the commander Sun Tzu, beneficial for early-game development. 

Gameplay Mechanics

The primary objective is to develop your city by constructing buildings, researching technologies, training troops, and expanding your territory. The City Hall serves as the central structure, with its level determining the maximum level of other buildings. Upgrading the City Hall unlocks new features and capabilities. 

Combat in RoK is real-time and involves strategic troop movements and formations. Players can control their armies on a seamless world map, engaging in battles against other players or AI-controlled barbarians. Commanders play a crucial role in combat, each possessing active and passive skills that can be enhanced through experience and upgrades. 

Alliances and Multiplayer Interaction

Forming or joining alliances is a significant aspect of RoK. Alliances enable collaborative gameplay, including joint attacks, resource sharing, and territorial expansion. Active participation in alliances can lead to greater rewards and a more engaging gaming experience. 

Monetization and In-Game Purchases

While RoK is free to play, it offers in-game purchases that can accelerate progress. Notably, the 30-day gem supply and the Growth Fund are considered cost-effective options for players looking to invest money into the game. These purchases provide substantial amounts of gems, which can be used for various in-game enhancements. 

Development and Reception

Developed by Lilith Games, "Rise of Kingdoms" was initially released as "Rise of Civilizations" before undergoing a name change in 2019. The game has been praised for its seamless zoom feature and real-time strategy elements, contributing to its popularity among mobile strategy games.

In "Rise of Kingdoms," the Formation System enhances strategic depth by allowing commanders to arrange troops into specific formations, each providing unique bonuses. Here's a breakdown of the available formations:

Arch Formation: Increases normal attack damage by 5%.

Wedge Formation: Enhances skill damage by 5%.

V Formation: Enables Ranged Mode, allowing troops to launch one ranged attack per second. Only commanders with the "Engineering" talent can use their active skill in this mode.

Echelon Formation: Amplifies percentage-based buffs granted to other troops by 20%, up to a maximum increase of 5% of their original value after upgrading.

Hollow Square Formation: Reduces all damage taken by 2%.

Line Formation: Boosts gathering speed for food, wood, stone, and gold by 10%.

Triple Line Formation: Increases march speed by 5%.

To utilize these formations, players must construct the State Forum building, which unlocks the Formation System and allows commanders to equip up to four armaments alongside a chosen formation. These armaments provide additional bonuses, with epic and legendary armaments having the potential to include inscriptions that confer even stronger buffs. 

Selecting the appropriate formation based on your strategic objectives—whether it's maximizing attack potential, enhancing defense, or improving resource gathering efficiency—can significantly influence the effectiveness of your troops in various scenarios.

In "Rise of Kingdoms," Inscriptions are special attributes that can be attached to Armaments to provide additional bonuses to your troops. These inscriptions can significantly enhance your army's performance, especially when aligned with the current game meta.

Understanding Inscriptions:

Types of Inscriptions: Inscriptions come in various rarities, with Legendary inscriptions offering the most substantial benefits. Each formation type, such as Wedge, Arch, or Echelon, has specific inscriptions associated with it.

Obtaining Inscriptions: Inscriptions can be acquired through various in-game events, rewards, or by transmuting existing armaments. It's essential to evaluate the value of inscriptions before deciding to keep or reroll them.

Meta-Defining Inscriptions:

The effectiveness of inscriptions can vary based on the current game meta and your specific strategy. However, some inscriptions have been consistently recognized for their utility:

Wedge Formation Inscriptions: This formation enhances skill damage, making it valuable for commanders who rely heavily on active skills. Selecting inscriptions that further boost skill damage or provide rage generation can be particularly effective.

Arch Formation Inscriptions: Focusing on normal attack damage, inscriptions that increase attack speed or troop health can complement this formation well.

Strategic Considerations:

Commander Pairings: Align inscriptions with commanders' strengths. For instance, if using a commander with high skill damage, inscriptions that boost skill damage or rage generation would be advantageous.

Battle Scenarios: Consider the type of battles you'll engage in. For open-field combat, inscriptions enhancing march speed or attack may be beneficial, while for city defense, those boosting health or defense could be more appropriate.

Types of Inscriptions:

Inscriptions are categorized into three main rarities:

Common Inscriptions: Provide basic enhancements.

Rare Inscriptions: Offer more substantial bonuses.

Special Inscriptions: Grant unique and powerful effects.

The probability of obtaining each type of inscription varies depending on the quality of the armament. For instance, when acquiring a legendary-quality armament, there's a 0.66% chance of obtaining one special inscription, a 6.55% chance for one rare inscription, and an 85.69% chance for one common inscription.

Examples of Inscriptions:

While the game features a wide array of inscriptions tailored to different formations and strategies, here are some notable examples:

Wedge Formation Inscriptions:

Enhanced Skill Damage: Increases skill damage by a certain percentage.

Rage Accumulation Boost: Speeds up rage generation, allowing for more frequent use of active skills.

Arch Formation Inscriptions:

Normal Attack Enhancement: Boosts normal attack damage.

Attack Speed Increase: Raises the rate of normal attacks.

For a comprehensive list of inscriptions and their specific effects, players often refer to community resources and guides, as the game does not provide an exhaustive in-game codex. Engaging with the community through forums and social media groups can be beneficial for obtaining detailed information.

Strategic Application:

Selecting the appropriate inscriptions is crucial for optimizing your commanders and formations. Aligning inscriptions with your commanders' strengths and your overall strategy can significantly enhance battlefield performance.

In "Rise of Kingdoms," the term DKP stands for Deaths per Kill Point. This metric is used by alliances and kingdoms to assess a player's efficiency and contribution during events like Kingdom vs. Kingdom (KvK).

Understanding DKP:

Kill Points (KP): Earned by defeating enemy troops, with higher-tier troops yielding more points.

Deaths: Refers to the number of your own troops lost in battles.

DKP Ratio: Calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the kill points. A lower DKP ratio indicates higher efficiency, meaning you're inflicting more damage relative to the losses you incur.

Importance of DKP:

Performance Evaluation: Alliances use the DKP ratio to evaluate a player's effectiveness in combat. A low DKP suggests that a player is contributing significantly to battles while minimizing their own losses.

Resource Management: Maintaining a favorable DKP ratio helps in conserving resources, as fewer troop losses mean less need for retraining and resource expenditure.

Strategic Participation: Players with efficient DKP ratios are often seen as valuable assets during wars and events, as they can deal substantial damage to enemies with minimal self-losses.

Calculating DKP:

To calculate your DKP ratio:

Determine Total Deaths: Sum up the total number of your troops that have died.

Calculate Total Kill Points: This information is available in your profile, showing the cumulative kill points you've earned.

Compute the Ratio: Divide the total deaths by the total kill points.

Formula: DKP Ratio = Total Deaths / Total Kill Points

Example:

If you have 1,000,000 deaths and 50,000,000 kill points:

DKP Ratio = 1,000,000 / 50,000,000 = 0.02

A DKP ratio of 0.02 indicates that for every kill point earned, you lose 0.02 troops, reflecting high combat efficiency.

Improving Your DKP Ratio:

Strategic Engagements: Choose battles wisely to maximize enemy losses while minimizing your own.

Commander Pairings: Utilize effective commander combinations that enhance troop survivability and damage output.

Research and Technology: Invest in military research to strengthen your troops and reduce casualties.

Alliance Coordination: Collaborate with alliance members for coordinated attacks, ensuring support and reducing individual losses.

By focusing on these strategies, you can enhance your DKP ratio, showcasing your prowess as a formidable and efficient warrior in "Rise of Kingdoms."
